			<h2>Early History of the club</h2>
			
			<p>The Texas Rangers began their carrer in Washington as the Senators. This was the result of the expansion of MLB and the 
			new team struggled in the beginning.</p>
		
			<p>For most of their existence, the new Senators were the definition of futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. 
			The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators--"Washington: first in war, first in peace and still 
			last in the American League." Frank Howard, known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, 
			winning two home run titles.</p>
			
			<p>The Washington Senators decided to make the move to Arlington, Texas in 1971 and have been there since.</p>
			
			<h2>Current Club Information</h2>
		
			<p>The Texas Rangers are a professional baseball team located in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, based in Arlington,
			 Texas. The Rangers franchise is currently a member of the Western Division of Major League Baseball's American League.</p>
			
			<p>The Texas Rangers Baseball Club has made six appearances in the MLB postseason, five following division championships
			 in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2010, and 2011, and as a Wild Card team in 2012. In 2010, the Rangers advanced past the Division
			 Series for the first time, defeating the Tampa Bay Rays. Texas then brought home their first American League Pennant 
			 after beating the New York Yankees in six games. In the 2010 World Series, the franchise's first, the Rangers fell 
			 to the San Francisco Giants in five games. Their lone victory made them the first Texas team to win a World Series game,
			 as the Houston Astros were swept in their 2005 World Series appearance. They repeated as American League champions the 
			 following year, then lost the 2011 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games.</p>
