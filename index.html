			<h2>History of Red Barn</h2>		
		
			<p>Red Barn. The name itself brings visions of pastures, serenity and blue skies. Red Barn Garden Center, now located on Pond Springs 
			Road just north of Spicewood Springs Road (in the old community of Jollyville), rests on the old Thompson homestead. Owner Emelie 
			McDaniel says, “People feel the history when they wander around the nearly four acres, sheltered by the big old oaks. The oaks were huge 
			when Mr. Thompson was a mere child here almost a century ago. Our visitors feel relaxed and enjoy being with the plants. 
			
			Our goal when we moved south onto this land in 2001 was to recreate the peace and serenity you feel in a nice garden, with the ease to get in and out. After 
			the horrific tragedy that struck our nation on Sept. 11, 2001, people came and walked around just for the comfort this place offers. People 
			came on their lunch hour and wandered around. The following month we held the largest Pumpkin Fest we’ve ever seen; families needed to connect 
			to a quitter place in time,” said McDaniel.
			
			Red Barn was founded by Scottie Gosh in 1978. He taught McDaniel his gardening secrets, such as growing organics and xeriscaping. When he 
			was ready to sell the business in 1993 he turned to McDaniel. The property that houses Red Barn has always been home to green 
			businesses-although they were putting greens. Holes from the Green Acres putt-putt golf course still dot the land and lend Red Barn some of 
			its appeal, not to mention a perpetual lawn of lush green AstroTurf. </p>
